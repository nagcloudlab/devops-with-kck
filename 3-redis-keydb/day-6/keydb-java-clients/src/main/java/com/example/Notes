Master - Replica
-----------------

    for Strong Cosistency  ( less Availability )

        Master to accept write oprtations
            - make sure connected with min number of replicas with Lag
            
    for Eventual consistency  ( for better availiblity )   

        -> master should accet all writes even if no replicas connected.

    -----------------------------

    at application side, for strong consistency, we can use waitReplicas() ( WAIT ) method
    for certain keys
